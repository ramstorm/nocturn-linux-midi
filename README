Fork of nocturn-linux-midi working on Debian 11.

Fixed a problem with USB hardware interface number.
Fixed a problem with multiple inheritance (not sure why it worked originally, probably due to an older python version).

Connect your Nocturn and run like below. UI should be shown and MIDI sent via ALSA port "Client-128" and "Midi Through".

sudo python2 NocturnGUI.py -f test.yaml


Original README below:

This is a basic implementation of the Novation Nocturn USB Controller [1] protocol, meant for Linux, though it might work elsewhere. The protocol was reverse-engineered by felicitus (timoahummel on github). This project will eventually allow the Nocturn to be used as a normal MIDI control surface in Linux. There is basic functionality now, but much is still broken. Notably broken/unimplemented things are:
* the GUI, for the most part - no on-the-fly config. it's really just a display
* smoothness - the rotary encoders seem to be a bit "jumpy", and I'm really not too sure why
* specifying inc/dec vs. value mode - all encoders just send a 0-127 value
* specifying key presses as actions - this is super useful in the original Automap, since you can assign random keyboard shortcuts to easy-access buttons (you do need to buy the "Pro" version though!)
* touch sensitivity - only turning encoders works, not just touching them

Dependencies:
* pyPortMIDI
* pubsub
* pyusb
* wxPython
* pyYAML

The configuration file should be self explanatory.  Format is YAML. See test.yaml for an example. The GUI will prompt you to open a configuration file on running, unless you specify --filename (-f) at the command prompt.

All MIDI signals sent are CC's. Note actions are not supported - I've found them to be useless with the Nocturn. Let me know if this is something you need, and I'll see what I can do, or just do it yourself! Start with Midder.py, and also take a look at NocturnActions.py

There is also an included udev rule - put it where your distro keeps udev rules.  For Arch, that is /etc/udev/rules.d
The rule will chgrp the Nocturn to "users" so make sure you are in that group, or change the udev rule.

Run the NocturnGUI.py script with
	python2 NocturnGUI.py [-f configfilepath]
and enjoy!

To see the messages being received from the hardware, run
	python2 NocturnHardware.py
at the command line. It will print each message received.
